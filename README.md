**85 buildable AI engineering portfolio projects**: grouped by theme, each with difficulty ratings, the skills it proves, and annotated reference resources.

*Curated with a focus on observability, evals, production serving, and real-world engineering rigor.*

</div>

---

This is the **comprehensive, browsable catalog**: 85 genuinely distinct, buildable AI engineering projects across 10 core themes, each tagged with difficulty, the exact skills it proves, and 1–3 typed, license-noted reference resources. **Pick by your skill gap, not by vibe:** find the theme where your portfolio is thinnest, ship 3–5 projects with real evals and a live URL, and write each README as a product spec. **One production project with proper evals beats five tutorial clones**: hiring managers scan for observability, error handling, eval rigor, and a live link in about 90 seconds.

> ⭐ **Star this repository** to bookmark the complete roadmap of AI engineering portfolio builds.

## 🏆 What wins: a 90-second scan

Hiring managers don't clone your repo, they scan it. This is what they look for, in order:

| Signal | Why it wins | Where to add it |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Production RAG** (hybrid + reranking + citations) | Most-cited must-have skill | [RAG apps](catalog/rag-apps.md) |
| **Eval suite** (faithfulness, precision, hallucination rate) | "Eval is the new system design" | [Evals & LLMOps](catalog/evals-llmops.md) |
| **Live deployment URL** (Vercel / Modal / Railway) | Reviewers won't clone, they click | [Production & serving](catalog/production-serving.md) |
| **README as product spec** (problem, arch diagram, eval numbers, cost) | Reads as a shipped product | every project |
| **Observability + cost tracking** (Langfuse / Phoenix) | Signals production maturity | [Evals & LLMOps](catalog/evals-llmops.md) |
| **Error handling** (retry, backoff, cost caps) | Signals reliability | [Agents](catalog/agents.md) |
| **Quantitative results** (X% lift, $Y/1k tokens, p50/p95) | Numbers beat claims | every project |
| **Open-source PR / issue history** | Real collaboration, not a tutorial clone | any framework above |

> [!WARNING]
> **Red flags that sink a portfolio:** "GPT-4 wrapper, no original work" · "no eval, just vibes" · "benchmark claims without numbers" · "five copy-pasted Streamlit demos." Depth on **4–6 evaluated projects** beats a long list of clones.

**Per-project polish checklist:** problem statement · architecture diagram · clean-clone setup (Dockerfile) · demo (live URL or 90-second GIF) · eval table (3+ metrics) · cost analysis ($/1k tokens, p50/p95) · failure modes · pinned repo (max 6) · a short design-tradeoffs write-up.

## 🆕 What's new (2026-07)

- **Launched**: 85 projects across 10 themes, each with difficulty, proven-skills, and annotated references.
- **New in 2026:** MCP-powered coding agents, computer-use/browser agents, GRPO/RL fine-tuning on verifiable rewards, reasoning-model distillation (R1-style), and ColPali-style visual document RAG.
- **"Eval is the new system design"**: expanded the Evals & LLMOps theme (CI gates, drift monitors, red-team suites) because it's the most under-built vs. how much interviewers ask.
- **Context engineering** added to the Prompt & DSPy theme, the 2026 replacement for string-fiddling.

## ❓ FAQ

**How many portfolio projects do I need to get an AI engineering job?**
Fewer than you think, **quality over quantity.** Ship **3–5 deeply-evaluated projects**, each with a live URL and an eval table, and **pin 6 max** on your GitHub. One production RAG project with proper evals beats five tutorial clones. Hiring managers scan for depth (observability, error handling, real numbers), not count.

**What are good beginner AI project ideas?**
Start 🟢: a [document Q&A RAG](catalog/rag-apps.md) with citations, a [resume parser](catalog/structured-extraction.md) with confidence scores, a [BPE tokenizer from scratch](catalog/llm-from-scratch.md), a [CLIP image search](catalog/multimodal.md), or a [support-ticket classifier](catalog/gtm-ai-pm.md). Each is a weekend build that proves one clear skill, then add an eval table to level it up.

**What are the best AI agent project ideas for 2026?**
The differentiated ones: a [multi-agent research team](catalog/agents.md) (LangGraph supervisor), an [MCP-powered coding agent](catalog/agents.md), a [persistent-memory agent](catalog/agents.md), or a [computer-use/browser agent](catalog/agents.md). What makes them stand out isn't the framework, it's **retry/backoff, cost caps, guardrails, and tracing.** Add those and you're past 90% of portfolios.

**How do I make a project stand out?**
Four things: (1) a **live URL**: reviewers click, they don't clone; (2) an **eval table** with 3+ metrics and real numbers; (3) a **README written as a product spec** (problem → architecture diagram → eval numbers → cost); (4) **cost/latency figures** ($/1k tokens, p50/p95). Bonus: an open-source PR to a framework you used. See the [90-second scan](#-what-wins-a-90-second-scan).

**Should I build breadth or depth?**
Depth. Use this catalog to find the *theme* where your portfolio is weakest, then go deep on 3–5 projects there. Focus on shipping with verifiable evals and clean architecture documentation.
