# 🤖 Agents & Tool-Use

> Agents are the theme with the widest quality gap: most portfolios ship a toy loop with no error handling. **Retry, backoff, cost caps, guardrails, and tracing** are what separate a demo from a shipped agent. Add those and one agent project outshines ten.

**Skills legend:** `tool-use / function-calling` · `orchestration (ReAct / plan-execute / supervisor)` · `state & memory` · `retries + backoff + cost tracking` · `guardrails` · `MCP`

### 5. Plan-and-execute agent (BabyAGI-style) — 🟡 Intermediate
Generate a plan, execute steps, re-plan on failure. Contrast with a pure ReAct agent on the same task and report steps/cost/success.
- **Skills proven:** planning, re-planning, task decomposition, comparison eval.
- 💻 [ashishpatel26/500-AI-Agents-Projects](https://github.com/ashishpatel26/500-AI-Agents-Projects) — 33.2k ⭐ · MIT.

### 6. Autonomous game-playing agent — 🟢 Beginner
An agent that plays a text game (Wordle, 2048, a maze) via tool calls, with a scoreboard over N runs. Fun, self-contained, and shows a clean action/observation loop.
- **Skills proven:** action loops, state tracking, deterministic eval over runs.

### 7. MCP-powered coding agent (GitHub / browser MCP) — 🔴 Advanced
An agent that uses Model Context Protocol servers (GitHub, filesystem, browser) to read issues, edit code, and open PRs. On-trend and highly differentiating for 2026.

### 8. Agent with persistent memory (MemGPT-style) — 🔴 Advanced
Long-term + working memory with summarization and retrieval, so the agent recalls facts across sessions. Show memory hits/misses in the trace.
- **Skills proven:** memory hierarchy, summarization, retrieval-augmented memory.
- 📄 [MemGPT — LLMs as Operating Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560) — the paper.
- 💻 [letta-ai/letta](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta) — Apache-2.0 · MemGPT successor (stateful agents).

### 9. Voice support agent — 🔴 Advanced
Real-time voice loop: STT → agent + tools (order lookup, refunds) → TTS, with barge-in and latency budgets. Full-stack and impressive live.
- **Skills proven:** streaming STT/TTS, tool-use under latency, turn-taking.
- 💻 [patchy631/ai-engineering-hub](https://github.com/patchy631/ai-engineering-hub) — 36.2k ⭐ · MIT · voice-agent builds.

### 10. Always-on briefing agent (HN / news / inbox) — 🟡 Intermediate
Runs on a schedule, pulls sources, dedupes, ranks, and delivers a personalized digest to Slack/email. A genuinely useful thing you'll keep running.
- **Skills proven:** scheduling, dedup/ranking, summarization, delivery integrations.
- 💻 [Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps](https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps) — 116k ⭐ · Apache-2.0 · briefing/news agents.

### 11. Computer-use / browser agent — 🔴 Advanced
An agent that drives a real browser to complete a task (fill a form, extract data, book something) with screenshots as observations. Bleeding-edge, high-signal.
- **Skills proven:** vision-grounded action, browser automation, failure recovery.
- 💻 [browser-use/browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) — MIT · LLM browser automation.
